# Example Identity Verification API with MTLS

This is a very simple REST API for use with a tutorial at my day job. 
This is a fork of [a similar example API](https://github.com/braveulysses/Example-Identity-Verification-API), 
but with MTLS support. It probably doesn't work yet.

## How to run it

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
