# Test certs

This directory includes certs and keys that can be used for testing, including
the server cert and key.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `.pem` | Public certificate |
| `.key` | Private key |
| `.csr` | Certificate signing request (you probably won't need this) |
| `.p12` | PKCS12 keystore. Password is *password* and the certificate alias is the name of the file without the extension, such as *alice*. | 
| `.jks` | Java keystore. Password is *password* and the certificate alias is the name of the file without the extension, such as *alice*. | 

The "alice" and "carol" certs are example certs that can be used as client certs.
They have common name (cn) values of "alice" and "carol", respectively.

For reference, the certs (including the server cert) were generated based on
steps at:
https://gist.github.com/mtigas/952344

This directory also includes a JKS trust store for the server cert. This trust 
store was generated by running:

```bash
keytool -import -alias server-cert -file 03-server.pem \
  -storetype JKS -keystore server-truststore.jks
``` 

## Using with an HTTP client

To use one of the client certs with [httpie](https://httpie.org), for example,
you would do:

```bash
$ http --verify=no --cert=01-alice.pem --cert-key=01-alice.key https://localhost:3000/users/user.1
```
